/**
 *  Use an SQKCoreDataOperation when you need to perform work with Core Data off the main thread.
You need to subclass and must override the `performWorkPrivateContext:` method, which is where you
should perform your work with Core Data. The operation will use it's `SQKContextManager` to obtain a
private managed object context. This is passed to the `performWorkPrivateContext:` method for you to
use. When your work is complete call the `completeOperationBySavingContext:` method passing in the
private context you have used. This saves the (private) managed object context, merges the changes
into main context, and finishes operation.
*   Add the operation to an NSOperationQueue that is not the `mainQueue` so that the computation is
performed in a background thread. As a private context is used any insertions, updates, deletions
etc must be done in a background thread, and using the correct operation queue will ensure that.
 *  Inspired by the obj-c.io article on threading and concurrency.
