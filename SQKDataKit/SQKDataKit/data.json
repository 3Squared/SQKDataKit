The gain was not worth this).\n\nThe problem came with ftrace_startup() which should always be called after\n__register_ftrace_function(), if you want this bug to be completely fixed.\n\nAnyway, this solution moves __register_ftrace_function() inside of\nftrace_startup() and removes the need to call them both.\n\nReported-by: Dave Wysochanski <dwysocha@redhat.com>\nFixes: ed926f9b35cd (\"ftrace: Use counters to enable functions to trace\")\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org # 3.0+\nSigned-off-by: Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org>","tree":{"sha":"c6e4eb64a98c37545958e1a73b95556f58e5b169","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/trees/c6e4eb64a98c37545958e1a73b95556f58e5b169"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/commits/8a56d7761d2d041ae5e8215d20b4167d8aa93f51","comment_count":0},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/8a56d7761d2d041ae5e8215d20b4167d8aa93f51","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/8a56d7761d2d041ae5e8215d20b4167d8aa93f51","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/8a56d7761d2d041ae5e8215d20b4167d8aa93f51/comments","author":{"login":"rostedt","id":1039303,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/58043e86f52c97091c77fe78a9d8928f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Feffe484f490dab62579f6bd39c58ec3f.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"58043e86f52c97091c77fe78a9d8928f","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt","html_url":"https://github.com/rostedt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"rostedt","id":1039303,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/58043e86f52c97091c77fe78a9d8928f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Feffe484f490dab62579f6bd39c58ec3f.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"58043e86f52c97091c77fe78a9d8928f","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt","html_url":"https://github.com/rostedt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rostedt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"4e58e54754dc1fec21c3a9e824bc108b05fdf46e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/4e58e54754dc1fec21c3a9e824bc108b05fdf46e","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/4e58e54754dc1fec21c3a9e824bc108b05fdf46e"}]},{"sha":"4e58e54754dc1fec21c3a9e824bc108b05fdf46e","commit":{"author":{"name":"Steven Rostedt (Red Hat)","email":"rostedt@goodmis.org","date":"2013-11-26T14:22:54Z"},"committer":{"name":"Steven Rostedt","email":"rostedt@goodmis.org","date":"2013-11-26T15:34:46Z"},"message":"tracing: Allow events to have NULL strings\n\nIf an TRACE_EVENT() uses __assign_str() or __get_str on a NULL pointer\nthen the following oops will happen:\n\nBUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at   (null)\nIP: [<c127a17b>] strlen+0x10/0x1a\n*pde = 00000000 ^M\nOops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 3.13.0-rc1-test+ #2\nHardware name:                  /DG965MQ, BIOS MQ96510J.86A.0372.2006.0605.1717 06/05/2006^M\ntask: f5cde9f0 ti: f5e5e000 task.ti: f5e5e000\nEIP: 0060:[<c127a17b>] EFLAGS: 00210046 CPU: 1\nEIP is at strlen+0x10/0x1a\nEAX: 00000000 EBX: c2472da8 ECX: ffffffff EDX: c2472da8\nESI: c1c5e5fc EDI: 00000000 EBP: f5e5fe84 ESP: f5e5fe80\n DS: 007b ES: 007b FS: 00d8 GS: 00e0 SS: 0068\nCR0: 8005003b CR2: 00000000 CR3: 01f32000 CR4: 000007d0\nStack:\n f5f18b90 f5e5feb8 c10687a8 0759004f 00000005 00000005 00000005 00200046\n 00000002 00000000 c1082a93 f56c7e28 c2472da8 c1082a93 f5e5fee4 c106bc61^M\n 00000000 c1082a93 00000000 00000000 00000001 00200046 00200082 00000000\nCall Trace:\n [<c10687a8>] ftrace_raw_event_lock+0x39/0xc0\n [<c1082a93>] ?

This is detected by waiting for the tc2_pm use count\n    for the target CPU to reach 0.\n\n  * Either the SPC must report that the CPU has asserted\n    STANDBYWFI, or the TC2 tile's reset control logic must be\n    holding the CPU in reset.\n\n    Just checking for STANDBYWFI is not sufficient, because this\n    signal is not latched when the the cluster is clamped off and\n    powered down: the relevant status bits just drop to zero.  This\n    means that STANDBYWFI status cannot be used for reliable\n    detection of the last CPU in a cluster reaching WFI.\n\nThis patch is required in order for kexec to work with MCPM on TC2.\n\nMCPM code was changed in commit 0de0d6467525 ('ARM: 7848/1: mcpm:\nImplement cpu_kill() to synchronise on powerdown'), and since then it\nwill hit a WARN_ON_ONCE() due to power_down_finish not being implemented\non the TC2 platform.\n\nSigned-off-by: Dave Martin <Dave.Martin@arm.com>\nAcked-by: Pawel Moll <pawel.moll@arm.com>\nReviewed-by: Nicolas Pitre <nico@linaro.org>\nSigned-off-by: Olof Johansson <olof@lixom.net>","tree":{"sha":"54675506d32ac62b8e8593abb98e629b4ffb8adc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/trees/54675506d32ac62b8e8593abb98e629b4ffb8adc"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/commits/33cb667a00f841fa036ad79f1aaaf7d6380c971d","comment_count":0},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/33cb667a00f841fa036ad79f1aaaf7d6380c971d","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/33cb667a00f841fa036ad79f1aaaf7d6380c971d","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/33cb667a00f841fa036ad79f1aaaf7d6380c971d/comments","author":null,"committer":{"login":"olofj","id":1046379,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/dcebcafafdb76f189f7e9527e5306b99?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b4b18673dd8064f8abe41d9160bb6f6.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"dcebcafafdb76f189f7e9527e5306b99","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olofj","html_url":"https://github.com/olofj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olofj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olofj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olofj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olofj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olofj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olofj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olofj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olofj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olofj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"9886e1fd096b8004a25bb8b7e5690ad1408ebc6f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/9886e1fd096b8004a25bb8b7e5690ad1408ebc6f","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/9886e1fd096b8004a25bb8b7e5690ad1408ebc6f"}]},{"sha":"f4a5d17efec95ee74113df62943494a2197c8bae","commit":{"author":{"name":"Thomas Renninger","email":"trenn@suse.de","date":"2013-11-16T13:39:22Z"},"committer":{"name":"Rafael J.

security subsystem updates from James Morris:\n \"In this patchset, we finally get an SELinux update, with Paul Moore\n  taking over as maintainer of that code.\n\n  Also a significant update for the Keys subsystem, as well as\n  maintenance updates to Smack, IMA, TPM, and Apparmor\"\n\nand since I wanted to know more about the updates to key handling,\nhere's the explanation from David Howells on that:\n\n \"Okay.  There are a number of separate bits.  I'll go over the big bits\n  and the odd important other bit, most of the smaller bits are just\n  fixes and cleanups.  If you want the small bits accounting for, I can\n  do that too.\n\n   (1) Keyring capacity expansion.\n\n        KEYS: Consolidate the concept of an 'index key' for key access\n        KEYS: Introduce a search context structure\n        KEYS: Search for auth-key by name rather than target key ID\n        Add a generic associative array implementation.\n        KEYS: Expand the capacity of a keyring\n\n     Several of the patches are providing an expansion of the capacity of a\n     keyring.  Currently, the maximum size of a keyring payload is one page.\n     Subtract a small header and then divide up into pointers, that only gives\n     you ~500 pointers on an x86_64 box.  However, since the NFS idmapper uses\n     a keyring to store ID mapping data, that has proven to be insufficient to\n     the cause.\n\n     Whatever data structure I use to handle the keyring payload, it can only\n     store pointers to keys, not the keys themselves because several keyrings\n     may point to a single key.  This precludes inserting, say, and rb_node\n     struct into the key struct for this purpose.\n\n     I could make an rbtree of records such that each record has an rb_node\n     and a key pointer, but that would use four words of space per key stored\n     in the keyring.  It would, however, be able to use much existing code.\n\n     I selected instead a non-rebalancing radix-tree type approach as that\n     could have a better space-used/key-pointer ratio.  I could have used the\n     radix tree implementation that we already have and insert keys into it by\n     their serial numbers, but that means any sort of search must iterate over\n     the whole radix tree.  Further, its nodes are a bit on the capacious side\n     for what I want - especially given that key serial numbers are randomly\n     allocated, thus leaving a lot of empty space in the tree.\n\n     So what I have is an associative array that internally is a radix-tree\n     with 16 pointers per node where the index key is constructed from the key\n     type pointer and the key description.  This means that an exact lookup by\n     type+description is very fast as this tells us how to navigate directly to\n     the target key.\n\n     I made the data structure general in lib/assoc_array.c as far as it is\n     concerned, its index key is just a sequence of bits that leads to a\n     pointer.  It's possible that someone else will be able to make use of it\n     also.  FS-Cache might, for example.\n\n   (2) Mark keys as 'trusted' and keyrings as 'trusted only'.\n\n        KEYS: verify a certificate is signed by a 'trusted' key\n        KEYS: Make the system 'trusted' keyring viewable by userspace\n        KEYS: Add a 'trusted' flag and a 'trusted only' flag\n        KEYS: Separate the kernel signature checking keyring from module signing\n\n     These patches allow keys carrying asymmetric public keys to be marked as\n     being 'trusted' and allow keyrings to be marked as only permitting the\n     addition or linkage of trusted keys.\n\n     Keys loaded from hardware during kernel boot or compiled into the kernel\n     during build are marked as being trusted automatically.  New keys can be\n     loaded at runtime with add_key().  They are checked against the system\n     keyring contents and if their signatures can be validated with keys that\n     are already marked trusted, then they are marked trusted also and can\n     thus be added into the master keyring.\n\n     Patches from Mimi Zohar make this usable with the IMA keyrings also.\n\n   (3) Remove the date checks on the key used to validate a module signature.\n\n        X.509: Remove certificate date checks\n\n     It's not reasonable to reject a signature just because the key that it was\n     generated with is no longer valid datewise - especially if the kernel\n     hasn't yet managed to set the system clock when the first module is\n     loaded - so just remove those checks.\n\n   (4) Make it simpler to deal with additional X.509 being loaded into the kernel.\n\n        KEYS: Load *.x509 files into kernel keyring\n        KEYS: Have make canonicalise the paths of the X.509 certs better to deduplicate\n\n     The builder of the kernel now just places files with the extension \".x509\"\n     into the kernel source or build trees and they're concatenated by the\n     kernel build and stuffed into the appropriate section.\n\n   (5) Add support for userspace kerberos to use keyrings.\n\n        KEYS: Add per-user_namespace registers for persistent per-UID kerberos caches\n        KEYS: Implement a big key type that can save to tmpfs\n\n     Fedora went to, by default, storing kerberos tickets and tokens in tmpfs.\n     We looked at storing it in keyrings instead as that confers certain\n     advantages such as tickets being automatically deleted after a certain\n     amount of time and the ability for the kernel to get at these tokens more\n     easily.\n\n     To make this work, two things were needed:\n\n     (a) A way for the tickets to persist beyond the lifetime of all a user's\n         sessions so that cron-driven processes can still use them.\n\n         The problem is that a user's session keyrings are deleted when the\n         session that spawned them logs out and the user's user keyring is\n         deleted when the UID is deleted (typically when the last log out\n         happens), so neither of these places is suitable.\n\n         I've added a system keyring into which a 'persistent' keyring is\n         created for each UID on request.  Each time a user requests their\n         persistent keyring, the expiry time on it is set anew.  If the user\n         doesn't ask for it for, say, three days, the keyring is automatically\n         expired and garbage collected using the existing gc.  All the kerberos\n         tokens it held are then also gc'd.\n\n     (b) A key type that can hold really big tickets (up to 1MB in size).\n\n         The problem is that Active Directory can return huge tickets with lots\n         of auxiliary data attached.  We don't, however, want to eat up huge\n         tracts of unswappable kernel space for this, so if the ticket is\n         greater than a certain size, we create a swappable shmem file and dump\n         the contents in there and just live with the fact we then have an\n         inode and a dentry overhead.  If the ticket is smaller than that, we\n         slap it in a kmalloc()'d buffer\"\n\n* 'for-linus2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jmorris/linux-security: (121 commits)\n  KEYS: Fix keyring content gc scanner\n  KEYS: Fix error handling in big_key instantiation\n  KEYS: Fix UID check in keyctl_get_persistent()\n  KEYS: The RSA public key algorithm needs to select MPILIB\n  ima: define '_ima' as a builtin 'trusted' keyring\n  ima: extend the measurement list to include the file signature\n  kernel/system_certificate.S: use real contents instead of macro GLOBAL()\n  KEYS: fix error return code in big_key_instantiate()\n  KEYS: Fix keyring quota misaccounting on key replacement and unlink\n  KEYS: Fix a race between negating a key and reading the error set\n  KEYS: Make BIG_KEYS boolean\n  apparmor: remove the \"task\" arg from may_change_ptraced_domain()\n  apparmor: remove parent task info from audit logging\n  apparmor: remove tsk field from the apparmor_audit_struct\n  apparmor: fix capability to not use the current task, during reporting\n  Smack: Ptrace access check mode\n  ima: provide hash algo info in the xattr\n  ima: enable support for larger default filedata hash algorithms\n  ima: define kernel parameter 'ima_template=' to change configured default\n  ima: add Kconfig default measurement list template\n  ...","tree":{"sha":"7c5d15da75d769d01f6a992c24c3490b3867d5b2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/trees/7c5d15da75d769d01f6a992c24c3490b3867d5b2"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/commits/78dc53c422172a317adb0776dfb687057ffa28b7","comment_count":0},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/78dc53c422172a317adb0776dfb687057ffa28b7","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/78dc53c422172a317adb0776dfb687057ffa28b7","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/78dc53c422172a317adb0776dfb687057ffa28b7/comments","author":{"login":"torvalds","id":1024025,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fb47627bc8c0bcdb36321edfbf02e916?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F53c1a7e0d8a715fc44fff5aa512db9c3.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"fb47627bc8c0bcdb36321edfbf02e916","url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"torvalds","id":1024025,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fb47627bc8c0bcdb36321edfbf02e916?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F53c1a7e0d8a715fc44fff5aa512db9c3.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"fb47627bc8c0bcdb36321edfbf02e916","url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"3eaded86ac3e7f00fb3eeb8162d89e9a34e42fb0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/3eaded86ac3e7f00fb3eeb8162d89e9a34e42fb0","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3eaded86ac3e7f00fb3eeb8162d89e9a34e42fb0"},{"sha":"62fe318256befbd1b4a6765e71d9c997f768fe79","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/62fe318256befbd1b4a6765e71d9c997f768fe79","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/62fe318256befbd1b4a6765e71d9c997f768fe79"}]},{"sha":"3eaded86ac3e7f00fb3eeb8162d89e9a34e42fb0","commit":{"author":{"name":"Linus Torvalds","email":"torvalds@linux-foundation.org","date":"2013-11-22T03:18:14Z"},"committer":{"name":"Linus Torvalds","email":"torvalds@linux-foundation.org","date":"2013-11-22T03:18:14Z"},"message":"Merge git://git.infradead.org/users/eparis/audit\n\nPull audit updates from Eric Paris:\n \"Nothing amazing.

critical region for shmctl\")\nrestructured the ipc shm to shorten critical region, but introduced a\npath where the return value could be -EPERM, even if the operation\nactually was performed.\n\nBefore the commit, the err return value was reset by the return value\nfrom security_shm_shmctl() after the if (!ns_capable(...)) statement.\n\nNow, we still exit the if statement with err set to -EPERM, and in the\ncase of SHM_UNLOCK, it is not reset at all, and used as the return value\nfrom shmctl.\n\nTo fix this, we only set err when errors occur, leaving the fallthrough\ncase

ea1e7ed33708c7a760419ff9ded0a6cb90586a50.\n\nAl points out that while the commit *does* actually create a separate\nslab for the page->ptl allocation, that slab is never actually used, and\nthe code continues to use kmalloc/kfree.\n\nDamien Wyart points out that the original patch did have the conversion\nto use kmem_cache_alloc/free, so it got lost somewhere on its way to me.\n\nRevert the half-arsed attempt that didn't do anything.  If we really do\nwant the special slab (remember: this is all relevant just for debug\nbuilds, so it's not necessarily all that critical) we might as well redo\nthe patch fully.\n\nReported-by: Al

The problem turned to be that the kernel\ninstalls a signal trampoline in the vDSO, and provides a DWARF CFI\nrecord for that trampoline.  This CFI describes the save location\nfor CR:\n\n  rsave (70, 38*RSIZE + (RSIZE - CRSIZE))\n\nwhich is correct for big-endian, but points to the wrong word on\nlittle-endian.   This is wrong no matter which ABI.\n\nIn addition, for the ELFv2 ABI, we should not only provide a CFI\nrecord for register 70 (cr2), but for all CR fields separately.\nStrictly speaking, I guess this would mean providing two separate\nvDSO images, one for ELFv1 processes and one for ELFv2 processes (or\nmaybe playing some tricks with conditional DWARF expressions).\nHowever, having CFI records for the other CR fields in ELFv1 is not\nactually wrong, they just will be ignored.   So it seems the simplest\nfix would be just to always provide CFI for all the fields.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ulrich Weigand <Ulrich.Weigand@de.ibm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Anton Blanchard

Some genetlink protocols we passing in constant\n    counts for their ops array rather than something like\n    ARRAY_SIZE(ops) or similar.  Also, some genetlink protocols were\n    using fixed IDs for their multicast groups.\n\n    We have to retain these fixed IDs to keep existing userland tools\n    working, but reserve them so that other multicast groups used by\n    other protocols can not possibly conflict.\n\n    In dealing with these two problems, we actually now use less state\n    management for genetlink operations and multicast groups.\n\n 2) When configuring interface hardware timestamping, fix several\n    drivers that simply do not validate that the hwtstamp_config value\n    is one the driver actually supports.  From Ben Hutchings.\n\n 3) Invalid memory references in mwifiex driver, from Amitkumar Karwar.\n\n 4) In dev_forward_skb(), set the skb->protocol in the right order\n    relative to skb_scrub_packet().  From Alexei Starovoitov.\n\n 5) Bridge erroneously fails to use the proper wrapper functions to make\n    calls to netdev_ops->ndo_vlan_rx_{add,kill}_vid.  Fix from Toshiaki\n    Makita.\n\n 6) When detaching a bridge port, make sure to flush all VLAN IDs to\n    prevent them from leaking, also from Toshiaki Makita.\n\n 7) Put in a compromise for TCP Small Queues so that deep queued devices\n    that delay TX reclaim non-trivially don't have such a performance\n    decrease.  One particularly problematic area is 802.11 AMPDU in\n    wireless.  From Eric Dumazet.\n\n 8) Fix crashes in tcp_fastopen_cache_get(), we can see NULL socket dsts\n    here.  Fix from Eric Dumzaet, reported by Dave Jones.\n\n 9) Fix use after free in ipv6 SIT driver, from Willem de Bruijn.\n\n10) When computing mergeable buffer sizes, virtio-net fails to take the\n    virtio-net header into account.  From Michael Dalton.\n\n11) Fix seqlock deadlock in ip4_datagram_connect() wrt.  statistic\n    bumping, this one has been with us for a while.  From Eric Dumazet.\n\n12) Fix NULL deref in the new TIPC fragmentation handling, from Erik\n    Hugne.\n\n13) 6lowpan bit used for traffic classification was wrong, from Jukka\n    Rissanen.\n\n14) macvlan has the same issue as normal vlans did wrt.  propagating LRO\n    disabling down to the real device, fix it the same way.  From Michal\n    Kubecek.\n\n15) CPSW driver needs to soft reset all slaves during suspend, from\n    Daniel Mack.\n\n16) Fix small frame pacing in FQ packet scheduler, from Eric Dumazet.\n\n17) The xen-netfront RX buffer refill timer isn't properly scheduled on\n    partial RX allocation success, from Ma JieYue.\n\n18) When ipv6 ping protocol support was added, the AF_INET6 protocol\n    initialization cleanup path on failure was borked a little.  Fix\n    from Vlad Yasevich.\n\n19) If a socket disconnects during a read/recvmsg/recvfrom/etc that\n    blocks we can do the wrong thing with the msg_name we write back to\n    userspace.  From Hannes Frederic Sowa.  There is another fix in the\n    works from Hannes which will prevent future problems of this nature.\n\n20) Fix route leak in VTI tunnel transmit, from Fan Du.\n\n*

This socket had sent and\nunsent data in the write queue. Sent data was restored in repair mode,\nthen the socket was switched from reapair mode and unsent data was\nrestored. After that the socket was switched back into repair mode.\n\nIn that moment we had a socket where write queue looks like this:\nsnd_una    snd_nxt   write_seq\n   |_________|________|\n             |\n\t  sk_send_head\n\nAfter a second switching from repair mode the state of socket was\nchanged:\n\nsnd_una          snd_nxt, write_seq\n   |_________ ________|\n             |\n\t  sk_send_head\n\nThis state is inconsistent, because snd_nxt and sk_send_head are not\nsynchronized.\n\nBellow you can find a call trace, how packets_out can be incremented\ntwice for one skb, if snd_nxt and sk_send_head are not synchronized.\nIn this case packets_out will be always positive, even when\nsk_write_queue is empty.\n\ntcp_write_wakeup\n\tskb = tcp_send_head(sk);\n\ttcp_fragment\n\t\tif (!before(tp->snd_nxt, TCP_SKB_CB(buff)->end_seq))\n\t\t\ttcp_adjust_pcount(sk, skb, diff);\n\ttcp_event_new_data_sent\n\t\ttp->packets_out += tcp_skb_pcount(skb);\n\nI think update of snd_nxt isn't required, when a socket is switched from\nrepair mode.  Because it's initialized in tcp_connect_init.

usual driver fixes and improvements\n\n  PS this time, we have a smaller number of patches.  While it is hard\n  to pinpoint to the reasons, I believe that it is mainly due to:\n\n   1) there are several patch series ready, but depending on DT review.\n      I decided to grant some extra time for DT maintainers to look on\n      it, as they're expecting to have more time with the changes agreed\n      during ARM mini-summit and KS.  If they can't review in time for\n      3.14, I'll review myself and apply for the next merge window.\n\n   2) I suspect that having both LinuxCon EU and LinuxCon NA happening\n      during the same merge window affected the development\n      productivity, as several core media developers participated on\n      both events\"\n\n* 'v4l_for_linus' of

This issue was exposed by Roland\nDreier in a previous review[1].\n\nSo the following patch is an attempt to a revised extensible command\ninfrastructure.\n\nThis improved extensible command infrastructure distinguish between\ncore (eg. legacy)'s command/response buffers from provider\n(eg. hardware)'s command/response buffers: each extended command\nimplementing function is given a struct ib_udata to hold core\n(eg. uverbs) input and output buffers, and another struct ib_udata to\nhold the hw (eg. provider) input and output buffers.\n\nHaving those buffers identified separately make it easier to increase\none buffer to support extension without having to add some code to\nguess the exact size of each command/response parts: This should make\nthe extended functions more reliable.\n\nAdditionally, instead of relying on command identifier being greater\nthan IB_USER_VERBS_CMD_THRESHOLD, the proposed infrastructure rely on\nunused bits in command field: on the 32 bits provided by command\nfield, only 6 bits are really needed to encode the identifier of\ncommands currently supported by the kernel. (Even using only 6 bits\nleaves room for about 23 new commands).\n\nSo this patch makes use of some high order bits in command field to\nstore flags, leaving enough room for more command identifiers than one\nwill ever need (eg. 256).\n\nThe new flags are used to specify if the command should be processed\nas an extended one or a legacy one. While designing the new command\nformat, care was taken to make usage of flags itself extensible.\n\nUsing high order bits of the commands field ensure that newer\nlibibverbs on older kernel will properly fail when trying to call\nextended commands. On the other hand, older libibverbs on newer kernel\nwill never be able to issue calls to extended commands.\n\nThe extended command header includes the optional response pointer so\nthat output buffer length and output buffer pointer are located\ntogether in the command, allowing proper parameters checking. This\nshould make implementing functions easier and safer.\n\nAdditionally the extended header ensure 64bits alignment, while making\nall sizes multiple of 8 bytes, extending the maximum buffer size:\n\n                             legacy      extended\n\n   Maximum command buffer:  256KBytes   1024KBytes (512KBytes + 512KBytes)\n  Maximum response buffer:  256KBytes   1024KBytes (512KBytes + 512KBytes)\n\nFor the purpose of doing proper buffer size accounting, the headers\nsize are no more taken in account in \"in_words\".\n\nOne of the odds of the current extensible infrastructure, reading\ntwice the \"legacy\" command header, is fixed by removing the \"legacy\"\ncommand header from the extended command header: they are processed as\ntwo different parts of the command: memory is read once and\ninformation are not duplicated: it's making clear that's an extended\ncommand scheme and not a different command scheme.\n\nThe proposed scheme will format input (command) and output (response)\nbuffers this way:\n\n- command:\n\n  legacy header +\n  extended header +\n  command data (core + hw):\n\n    +----------------------------------------+\n    | flags     |   00      00    |  command |\n    |        in_words    |   out_words       |\n    +----------------------------------------+\n    |                 response               |\n    |                 response               |\n    | provider_in_words | provider_out_words |\n    |                 padding                |\n    +----------------------------------------+\n    |                                        |\n    .              <uverbs input>            .\n    .

incorrect underflow check\n\nWhen a memcg is deleted mem_cgroup_reparent_charges() moves charged\nmemory to the parent memcg.  As of v3.11-9444-g3ea67d0 \"memcg: add per\ncgroup writeback pages accounting\" there's bad pointer read.  The goal\nwas to check for counter underflow.  The counter is a per cpu counter\nand there are two problems with the code:\n\n (1) per cpu access function isn't used, instead a naked pointer is used\n     which easily causes oops.\n (2) the check doesn't sum all cpus\n\nTest:\n  $ cd /sys/fs/cgroup/memory\n  $ mkdir x\n  $ echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n  $ (echo $BASHPID >> x/tasks && exec cat) &\n  [1] 7154\n  $ grep ^mapped x/memory.stat\n  mapped_file 53248\n  $ echo 7154 > tasks\n  $ rmdir x\n  <OOPS>\n\nThe fix is to remove the check.  It's currently dangerous and isn't\nworth fixing it to use something expensive, such as\npercpu_counter_sum(), for each reparented page.  __this_cpu_read() isn't\nenough to fix this because there's no guarantees of the current cpus\ncount.  The only guarantees is that the sum of all per-cpu counter is >=\nnr_pages.\n\nFixes: 3ea67d06e467 (\"memcg: add per cgroup writeback pages accounting\")\nReported-and-tested-by: Flavio Leitner <fbl@redhat.com>\nSigned-off-by: Greg Thelen <gthelen@google.com>\nReviewed-by: Sha Zhengju <handai.szj@taobao.com>\nAcked-by: Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org>\nSigned-off-by: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>","tree":{"sha":"db8e26fd7c5758ce2747b98f4ec7e1af32198740","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/trees/db8e26fd7c5758ce2747b98f4ec7e1af32198740"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/commits/6920a1bd037374a632d585de127b6f945199dcb8","comment_count":0},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/6920a1bd037374a632d585de127b6f945199dcb8","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/6920a1bd037374a632d585de127b6f945199dcb8","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/6920a1bd037374a632d585de127b6f945199dcb8/comments","author":null,"committer":{"login":"torvalds","id":1024025,"avatar_url":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/fb47627bc8c0bcdb36321edfbf02e916?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F53c1a7e0d8a715fc44fff5aa512db9c3.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"fb47627bc8c0bcdb36321edfbf02e916","url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torvalds/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"4f794ee8c40119366e0be45f9d49e7ff1a89b79b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/4f794ee8c40119366e0be45f9d49e7ff1a89b79b","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/4f794ee8c40119366e0be45f9d49e7ff1a89b79b"}]},{"sha":"e1466ad5b1aeda303f9282463d55798d2eda218c","commit":{"author":{"name":"Алексей Крамаренко","email":"alexeyk13@yandex.ru","date":"2013-11-01T13:26:38Z"},"committer":{"name":"Greg Kroah-Hartman","email":"gregkh@linuxfoundation.org","date":"2013-11-01T16:33:56Z"},"message":"USB: serial: ftdi_sio: add id for Z3X Box device\n\nCustom VID/PID for Z3X Box device, popular tool for cellphone flashing.\n\nSigned-off-by: Alexey E.

The reason was unclear, esp. since it involved various machines (e.g.\nJ5600, J6750 and SuperDome). Testing showed, that those crashes didn't happened\nwhen less than 4GB were installed, or if a 32bit Linux kernel was booted.\n\nIn the end, the fix for those SMP problems is trivial:\nDuring the early phase of the initialization of the CPUs, including the monarch\nCPU, the PDC_PSW firmware function to enable WIDE (=64bit) mode is called.\nIt's documented that this firmware function may clobber various registers, and\none one of those possibly clobbered registers is %cr30 which holds the task\nthread info pointer.\n\nNow, if %cr30 would always have been clobbered, then this bug would have been\ndetected much earlier. But lots of testing finally showed, that - at least for\n%cr30 - on some machines only the upper 32bits of the 64bit register suddenly\nturned zero after the firmware call.\n\nSo, after finding the root cause, the explanation for the various crashes\nbecame clear:\n- On 32bit SMP Linux kernels all upper 32bit were zero, so we didn't faced this\n  problem.\n- Monarch CPUs in 64bit mode always booted sucessfully, because the inital task\n  thread info pointer was below 4GB.\n- Secondary CPUs booted sucessfully on machines with less than 4GB RAM because\n  the upper 32bit were zero anyay.\n- Secondary CPus failed to boot if we had more than 4GB RAM and the task thread\n  info pointer was located above the 4GB boundary.\n\nFinally, the patch to fix this problem is trivial by saving the %cr30 register\nbefore the firmware call and restoring it afterwards.\n\nSigned-off-by: Helge Deller <deller@gmx.de>\nSigned-off-by: John David Anglin <dave.anglin@bell.net>\nCc: <stable@vger.kernel.org> # 2.6.12+\nSigned-off-by: Helge Deller <deller@gmx.de>","tree":{"sha":"64c66c586e9667b2218758139cd8dc0348a75bd3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/trees/64c66c586e9667b2218758139cd8dc0348a75bd3"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/commits/54e181e073fc1415e41917d725ebdbd7de956455","comment_count":0},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/54e181e073fc1415e41917d725ebdbd7de956455","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/54e181e073fc1415e41917d725ebdbd7de956455","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/54e181e073fc1415e41917d725ebdbd7de956455/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"20582e34c8c1364bce15d776bce3c9c0f108132f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/20582e34c8c1364bce15d776bce3c9c0f108132f","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/20582e34c8c1364bce15d776bce3c9c0f108132f"}]},{"sha":"20582e34c8c1364bce15d776bce3c9c0f108132f","commit":{"author":{"name":"Linus Torvalds","email":"torvalds@linux-foundation.org","date":"2013-10-26T03:38:47Z"},"committer":{"name":"Linus Torvalds","email":"torvalds@linux-foundation.org","date":"2013-10-26T03:38:47Z"},"message":"Merge tag 'pm+acpi-3.12-rc7' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm\n\nPull ACPI and power management fixes from\n \"These fix two bugs in the intel_pstate driver, a hibernate bug leading\n  to nasty resume failures sometimes and acpi-cpufreq initialization bug\n  that causes problems to happen during module unload when intel_pstate\n  is in use.\n\n  Specifics:\n\n   -

gpmi: fix ECC regression\n\nThe \"legacy\" ECC layout used until 3.12-rc1 uses all the OOB area by\ncomputing the ECC strength and ECC step size ourselves.\n\nCommit 2febcdf84b (\"mtd: gpmi: set the BCHs geometry with the ecc info\")\nmakes the driver use the ECC info (ECC strength and ECC step size)\nprovided by the MTD code, and creates a different NAND ECC layout\nfor the BCH, and use the new ECC layout. This causes a regression:\n\n   We can not mount the ubifs which was created by the old NAND ECC layout.\n\nThis patch fixes this issue by reverting to the legacy ECC layout.\n\nWe will probably introduce a new device-tree property to indicate that\nthe new ECC layout can be used. For now though, for the imminent 3.12\nrelease, we just unconditionally revert to the 3.11 behaviour.\n\nThis leaves a harmless cosmetic warning about an unused function. At\nthis point in the cycle I really don't care.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Woodhouse <David.Woodhouse@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Brian Norris <computersforpeace@gmail.com>\nAcked-by: Huang Shijie <b32955@freescale.com>\nAcked-by: Marek Vasut <marex@denx.de>\nTested-by: Marek Vasut <marex@denx.de>","tree":{"sha":"957ca0ef07f82ded1c5836f4bb239d357d8a2df0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/trees/957ca0ef07f82ded1c5836f4bb239d357d8a2df0"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/commits/031e2777e03401d629e62602c8ce42b017732d4d","comment_count":0},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/031e2777e03401d629e62602c8ce42b017732d4d","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/031e2777e03401d629e62602c8ce42b017732d4d","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/031e2777e03401d629e62602c8ce42b017732d4d/comments","author":null,"committer":{"login":"computersforpeace","id":2268082,"avatar_url":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6b684448d0252eb90745499c702b0ab5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F61572b15e769c85bef1220c41a275578.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"6b684448d0252eb90745499c702b0ab5","url":"https://api.github.com/users/computersforpeace","html_url":"https://github.com/computersforpeace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computersforpeace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computersforpeace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computersforpeace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computersforpeace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computersforpeace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computersforpeace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computersforpeace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computersforpeace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/computersforpeace/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"18a84e935ef3b283e86426827a2a1d524bb7eb8e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/18a84e935ef3b283e86426827a2a1d524bb7eb8e","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/18a84e935ef3b283e86426827a2a1d524bb7eb8e"}]},{"sha":"05e16745c0c471bba313961b605b6da3b21a853d","commit":{"author":{"name":"Gu Zheng","email":"guz.fnst@cn.fujitsu.com","date":"2013-10-25T10:15:06Z"},"committer":{"name":"Al Viro","email":"viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk","date":"2013-10-25T14:46:40Z"},"message":"seq_file: always update file->f_pos in seq_lseek()\n\nThis issue was first pointed out by Jiaxing Wang several months ago, but no\nfurther comments:\nhttps://lkml.org/lkml/2013/6/29/41\n\nAs we know pread() does not change f_pos, so after pread(), file->f_pos\nand m->read_pos become different.

 There's no advantage in using a hardcoded name for the mtd device.\n  Instead use the provided by the platform_device.\n\nThe MTD name was changed to use the one provided by the platform_device.\nHowever, this can be problematic as some users want to set partitions\nusing the kernel parameter 'mtdparts', where the name is needed.\n\nTherefore, to avoid regressions in users relying in 'mtdparts' we revert\nthe change and use the previous one 'pxa3xx_nand-0'.\n\nWhile at it, let's put a big comment and prevent this change from happening\never again.\n\nSigned-off-by:
